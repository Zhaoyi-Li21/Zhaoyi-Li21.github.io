Hi:wave:, I am Zhaoyi Li, a computer science PhD student under the collaboration programm of [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) (School of Computer Science and Technology, adviced by Prof.[Defu Lian](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=QW0ad4sAAAAJ&hl=en)) and [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) (Department of Computer Science, co-adviced by Prof.[Ying Wei](https://wei-ying.net/) and Prof.[Linqi Song](https://sites.google.com/site/aisquaredlab/about-us/linqi)).
The most fortunate thing for my early PhD life is that I met up with my brilliant professors!
Previously, I got my Bachelor degree in Computer Science and Technology from University of Science and Technology of China in 2022, under the supervision of Prof.[Cheng Li](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~chengli7/).

My research interest includes machine learning and natural language processing. Specifically, I work on making human beings and neural network systems better understand each other (i.e., generalization and interpretability). I currently focus on investigating the compositionality of language models from the perspectives of generalization, reasoning pattern, implicit structure and so on. I would love to discuss on related topics should anyone is interested (always feel free to drop me an email: lizhaoyi777\[AT\]mail.ustc.edu.cn)!

Understanding and Patching Compositional Reasoning in LLMs (**ACL'2024 Findings**)

**Zhaoyi Li**, Gangwei Jiang, Hong Xie, Linqi Song, Defu Lian and Ying Wei

[**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14328) [**Code**](https://github.com/Zhaoyi-Li21/creme) [**Blog(in Chinese)**](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/684626522)
- We interpret the internal mechanism of compositional step-by-step reasoning on multi-hop factual knowledge inside large language models and propose a light-weight method based on model editing to patch their compositional reasoning errors.

Benchmarking and Improving Compositional Generalization of Multi-aspect Controllable Text Generation (**ACL'2024**)

Tianqi Zhong$^\*$, **Zhaoyi Li**$^\*$, Quan Wang, Linqi Song, Ying Wei, Defu Lian and Zhendong Mao

[**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04232) [**Code**](https://github.com/tqzhong/CG4MCTG)
- We propose CompMCTG, systematically unveiling the shortcoming of current multi-aspect controllable text generation methods on compositional generalization. Besides, we propose MetaMCTG, a meta-learning based training framework to improve the compositional generalization performance of current methods.

Learning to Substitute Spans towards Improving Compositional Generalization (**ACL'2023 Oral**)

**Zhaoyi Li**, Ying Wei and Defu Lian

[**Paper**](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.157/) [**Code**](https://github.com/Zhaoyi-Li21/Compgen_l2s2)
- We propose L2S2, a adversarial learning based text data augmentation scheme to improve the compositional generalization performance of neural sequence models (including LSTMs, Transformers and Pre-trained LMs).
